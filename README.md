# csc111project

This project requires Python 3.13 as well as other Python libraries listed in the file named requirements.txt. To download these libraries, navigate to the ‘Python Packages’ menu in PyCharm, search and download the library names listed in the requirements text file.

This project also requires you to download the two module files, classes.py and visualization.py. You will have to put this file in the same folder/directory
as the main file and the dataset files.

To obtain the datasets for testing, we’ve provided two datasets of the NBA teams ‘Los Angeles Lakers’ and ‘Dallas Mavericks’ in a zip folder called tophoops.zip. To use the datasets, unzip the folder and move the two files into the main folder you are using to run this project’s modules.


To run the program, run the file main.py in the Python console. To start the simulation, initialize a LineupSimulation instance to a variable. To view the heatmap of the team data file, use the LineupSimulation method: visualize_heatmap().  Then you will be able to see a new tab open displaying the heatmap. To view the graph and the optimal 5-player lineup of this team, use the LineupSimulation method: show_graph(). Then you will be able to see a new tab open displaying the graph and the color-coded players.
